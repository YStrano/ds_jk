<p>This course covers some introductory ideas for data acquisition,
analysis, and deployment on the web using the Python computer language.
We cover basic data analysis and visualization, web scraping and
crawling, some natural language processing and text analysis, web
applications with Django, and game design with PyGame. By the end,
students should feel comfortable pursuing further advanced work with
Python and design.</p>

<p>The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic
and artistic excellence. These resources include: - University
Libraries: <a class="reference external" href="http://library.newschool.edu">http://library.newschool.edu</a> - University Learning Center:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center">http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center</a> - University Disabilities
Service: www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/ In keeping with
the university’s policy of providing equal access for students with
disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic
accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations
will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will
also need to contact Student Disability Service (SDS). SDS will conduct
an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will provide an academic
accommodation notification letter for you to bring to me. At that point,
I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in
relation to this course. Student Ombuds:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newschool.edu/intercultural-support/ombuds/">http://www.newschool.edu/intercultural-support/ombuds/</a> The Student
Ombuds office provides students assistance in resolving conflicts,

<div class="section" id="University-Policies">
<h2>University Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#University-Policies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>University, College/School, and Program Policies [Faculty must include
policies on academic honesty and attendance, as well as any required
college/program policies]</p>
<p>Academic Honesty and Integrity Compromising your academic integrity may
lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more
of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course,
academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the
university, or dismissal from the university.</p>
<p>Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on
academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of
sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their
work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility
of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for
correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of
others. The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures,
is found at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newschool.edu/policies/">http://www.newschool.edu/policies/</a></p>
<p>Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found
on the Learning Center’s website:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/avoiding-plagiarism.pdf">http://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/avoiding-plagiarism.pdf</a>

dishonesty may be included here.]</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="Attendance">
<h2>Attendance<a class="headerlink" href="#Attendance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>“Absences may justify some grade reduction and a total of four absences
mandate a reduction of one letter grade for the course. More than four
absences mandate a failing grade for the course, unless there are
extenuating circumstances, such as the following: an extended illness
requiring hospitalization or visit to a physician (with documentation);
a family emergency, e.g. serious illness (with written explanation);
observance of a religious holiday.</p>
<p>The attendance and lateness policies are enforced as of the first day of
classes for all registered students. If registered during the first week
of the add/drop period, the student is responsible for any missed
assignments and coursework.</p>
<p>For significant lateness, the instructor may consider the tardiness as
an absence for the day. Students failing a course due to attendance
should consult with an academic advisor to discuss options. Divisional
and/or departmental/program policies serve as minimal guidelines, but
policies may contain additional elements determined by the faculty
member.”</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Student-Course-Ratings">
<h2>Student Course Ratings<a class="headerlink" href="#Student-Course-Ratings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>During the last two weeks of the semester, students are asked to provide
feedback for each of their courses through an online survey. They cannot
view grades until providing feedback or officially declining to do so.
Course evaluations are a vital space where students can speak about the
learning experience. It is an important process which provides valuable
data about the successful delivery and support of a course or topic to
both the faculty and administrators. Instructors rely on course rating
surveys for feedback on the course and teaching methods, so they can
understand what aspects of the class are most successful in teaching
students, and what aspects might be improved or changed in future.
Without this information, it can be difficult for an instructor to
reflect upon and improve teaching methods and course design. In
addition, program/department chairs and other administrators review
course surveys. Instructions are available online at
