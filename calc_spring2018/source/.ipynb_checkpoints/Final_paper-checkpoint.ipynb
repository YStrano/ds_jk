    "**Product**: A paper describing the socio-historical background of the Lotka Volterra model.  You are to read the chapter from [Kingsland](files/kingsland.pdf), and the few pages from [Braun](files/braun_dancona.pdf).  From these you should produce at least two pages, balancing a historical/contextualization of the problem situation *and* a mathematical formulation of the general model.  Finally, you should answer the problem below using our qualitative solution methods from class.  This would be an example included as a section.\n",
