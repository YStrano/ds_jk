    "KRS-One began his recording career as one third of the hip hop group Boogie Down Productions, or BDP, alongside DJ Scott La Rock and Derrick \"D-Nice\" Jones. After being rejected by radio DJs Mr. Magic and Marley Marl, KRS-One would go on to diss the two and those associated with them, sparking what would later be known as The Bridge Wars. Additionally, KRS-One had taken offense to \"The Bridge\", a song by Marley Marl's protege, MC Shan (later on, KRS-One produced an album with Marley Marl in 2007) The song could be interpreted as a claim that Queensbridge was the monument of hip-hop, though MC Shan has repeatedly denied this claim. Still, KRS-One \"dissed\" the song with the BDP record \"South Bronx.\" Next, a second round of volleys would ensue with Shan's \"Kill That Noise\" and BDP's \"The Bridge Is Over.\" KRS-One, demonstrating his nickname \"The Blastmaster\", gave a live performance against MC Shan, and many conceded he had won the battle. Many[who?] believe this live performance to be the first MC battle where rappers attack each other, instead of a battle between who can get the crowd more hyped.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Parker and Sterling decided to form a rap group together, initially calling themselves \"Scott La Rock and the Celebrity Three\". That was short-lived, however, as the two peripheral members quit, leaving Parker (now calling himself KRS-One) and Sterling. They then decided to call themselves \"Boogie Down Productions\". \"Success is the Word\", a 12-inch single produced by David Kenneth Eng and Kenny Beck, was released on indie Fresh/Sleeping Bag Records (under the group name \"12:41\") but did not enjoy commercial success. Boogie Down Productions released their debut album Criminal Minded in 1987. The album, whose cover pictured BDP draped in ammunition and brandishing guns, is often credited with setting the template for the burgeoning genres of hardcore and gangsta rap. Scott La Rock was killed in a shooting later that year, after attempting to mediate a dispute between teenager and BDP member Derrick \"D-Nice\" Jones and local hoodlums.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this time KRS-One also gained acclaim as one of the first MCs to incorporate Jamaican style into hip-hop, using the Zung gu zung melody, originally made famous by Yellowman in Jamaican dance halls earlier in the decade.[4] While KRS-One used Zunguzung styles in a more powerful and controversial manner, especially in his song titled \"Remix for P is Free\", he can still be credited as one of the more influential figures to bridge the gap between Jamaican music and American Hip-Hop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the fatal shooting of Scott La Rock in 1987, KRS was determined to continue Boogie Down Productions through the tragedy, releasing the album By All Means Necessary in 1988. He was joined by beatboxer D-Nice, rapper Ramona \"Ms. Melodie\" Parker (whose marriage to Kris would last from 1988 to 1992), and Kris's younger brother DJ Kenny Parker, among others. However, Boogie Down Productions would remain Kris's show, and their content would become increasingly political through its subsequent releases Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop, Edutainment, Live Hardcore Worldwide and Sex and Violence.\n",
    "\n",
    "KRS-One was the primary initiator behind the H.E.A.L. compilation and the Stop the Violence Movement; for the latter he would attract many prominent emcees to appear on the 12-inch single \"Self Destruction\". As Parker adopted this \"humanist\", less defensive approach, he turned away from his \"Blastmaster\" persona and towards that of \"The Teacha\", although he has constantly used \"Blastmaster\" throughout his career.\n",

       "'Lawrence \"Kris\" Parker (born August 20, 1965), better known by his stage names KRS-One, and Teacha, is an American rapper and occasional producer from The Bronx, New York City, New York. KRS-One rose to prominence as part of the hip hop music group Boogie Down Productions, which he formed with DJ Scott La Rock in the mid-1980s. Boogie Down Productions received heavy impact upon their upstart, often being considered one of the first rap groups to inspire both gangsta rap and conscious rap. As well, they received numerous awards and critical acclaim in their early years. Following the release of the group\\'s debut album, Criminal Minded, La Rock was shot and killed, but KRS-One continued the group, effectively as a solo project. He began releasing records under his own name in 1993. KRS-One is politically active, having started the Stop the Violence Movement, after the death of Scott La Rock.'"
